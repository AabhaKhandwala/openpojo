PojoValidator is used to run all Pojo validations.

### Introduction ###

PojoValidator is a class that is used to hold all the "boundaries" you want to test for, and execute those checks.

### Details ###

Working with this class is very simple, first create an instance of the class, and then configure the instance with the [Rule](Rule.md)(s) and/or [Tester](Tester.md)(s) you want to run your Pojo's through.

see [PojoTest](http://code.google.com/p/openpojo/source/browse/trunk/example/com/openpojo/PojoTest.java) for a sample on how to configure PojoValidator.
